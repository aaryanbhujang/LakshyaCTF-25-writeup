### üß† Challenge Description

> In the hall of echoes, eight pillars stand tall,  
> The first whispers ‚Äú16‚Äù as the ancient call.  
> Next, ‚Äú98‚Äù glimmers on the second in line,  
> Then ‚Äú89‚Äù follows, a secret sign.  
> ‚Äú15‚Äù the fourth, then ‚Äú35‚Äù in the lore,  
> ‚Äú75‚Äù echoes next from the old stone door.  
> The last two, ‚Äú17‚Äù and ‚Äú17‚Äù, complete the thrall,  
> Combine them to yield a product, a product of prime.  
>  
> High above in a celestial dance,  
> Seven stars conceal a code at a glance.  
> Begin with ‚Äú62‚Äù, then ‚Äú78‚Äù appears bright,  
> A ‚Äú04‚Äù then ‚Äú06‚Äù in the shimmering night.  
> Follow with ‚Äú667‚Äù, then ‚Äú94‚Äù in sight,  
> Ending with ‚Äú81‚Äù ‚Äì the exponent of light.  
>  
> Yet whispers linger of an unseen art‚Äî  
> A secret mirror that sets the truth apart.  
> For those who dare invert what‚Äôs on display,  
> A hidden key awaits to show the way.  
> Unlock that private cipher, subtle yet prime,  
> And inscribe its secret as your flag in time:  
>  
> `LakshyaCTF{key}`

### üß© Solution Overview

- From the first stanza (the pillars), we extract:

16 | 98 | 89 | 15 | 35 | 75 | 17 | 17 ‚Üí N = 1698891535751717 (modulus)


- From the second stanza (the stars), we extract:

62 | 78 | 04 | 06 | 667 | 94 | 81 ‚Üí e = 627804066679481 (public exponent)

### üîç Step-by-Step

1. **Factor the modulus:**

 Using [FactorDB](http://factordb.com), we factor:

1698891535751717 = 23285137 √ó 72960341


2. **Compute œÜ(N):**

œÜ(N) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (23285137 - 1) * (72960341 - 1)


3. **Compute the private exponent (d):**

Using Python and the `Crypto.Util.number` library:
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse

p = 23285137
q = 72960341
e = 627804066679481
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d = inverse(e, phi)

print(d)
```
Output:

d = 1216997203097801
